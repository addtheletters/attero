A conglomerate of Unity experiments with the goal of producing a musically-synched visual spectacle, and perhaps a tactical strategy game on top of it all to tell a harshly contrasting message about war. Inspired by movie shots of anti-aircraft tracers filling the air, and by Swedish metal songs.

This project includes:
- simple ballistics
- tracers
- gun turrets
- framework for exploding things
- a music visualizer of sorts

planned:
- relatively accurate shot-leading and trajectory estimation
- pyrotechnic choreography / music visualization
- bombs and artillery
- planes
- city / street / building generator
- unit selection and movement
